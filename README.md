# Gaussian-manual-vs-coded
This code implements a Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier from scratch using NumPy. It computes class-wise means, variances, and priors, applies Gaussian likelihoods, and predicts via log-posterior maximization. Its accuracy and runtime are then compared with scikit-learn’s GaussianNB on synthetic data.
